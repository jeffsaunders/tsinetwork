				<span class="dropcap square large" style="background-color: #FFFFFF; padding: 5px 5px 100px 0px;"><img src="images/TRFDennisHeadshot.jpg" alt="Dennis Tobler"></span>Dennis Tobler is a fixture in the sports gaming and horse race handicapping business in Las Vegas. A life-long sports participant and sports & horse race bettor, the Nebraska-born and football-bred Tobler has been one of the country's top handicappers. He is one of a handful of experts who help set the betting line in Las Vegas and offshore. Having begun his career in 1972, his sources run very deep in this close knit business.<br><br style="line-height: 1.5;">
				<p>During the 1960's Dennis was a two-time all-state football player in Nebraska, where they really know their football! Through the 1970's he managed to break nearly every private bookmaker in the Midwest and by 1980 Dennis was ready to move his tack to the "<strong>show</strong>" - the bright lights of Las Vegas.</p>
				<p>In 1982, Dennis founded his Las Vegas based sports information service, one of only four licensed services at the time, to sell sports and horse racing handicapping information through "800," "900," and "976" telephone services.</p>
				<p>Not one to sit on his laurals, in 1988 Dennis formed the TSI Network to begin production and syndication of <strong><em>Football Forecast Weekly</em></strong> (<a href="https://footballforecast.com" target="_self" title="FootballForecast.com">FootballForecast.com</a>), his first nationally syndicated television show. Soon after the show's launch, the Orange County Register (Anaheim, CA) dubbed it the <em>"BEST SHOW EVER when it comes to imparting football information."</em> The show's popularity immediately soared and Dennis soon began producing <strong><em>Thoroughbred Racing Forecast</em></strong>, a series of horse racing specials to compliment <strong><em>Football Forecast Weekly</em></strong>.</p>
				<p>After nearly 20 years, <strong><em>Football Forecast Weekly</em></strong> is still going strong and is now one of the longest running programs of it's type. Dennis is now one of the most sought after celebrities in the business and has appeared as the principle talent on over 220 nationally televised shows and thousands of radio programs. His unmatched expertise is the reason he has become a consultant to many sports books around the world.</p>
				<p>Since the birth of offshore gaming, Dennis has become a major player in all aspects of this growth industry, from consulting on software and business setup to leveraging his television production talents and actually producing television programs in Antigua, St. Kitts, Curacao, and of course, Costa Rica.</p>
				<p>Dennis retired from public handicapping in 2005 and now concentrates on his racing stable and wagering in Las Vegas. He also enjoys dabbling in real estate and development both in Las Vegas and abroad.</p>
<!--				<p>In 2006, Dennis co-founded M&S Racing Stable, dedicated to claiming and purchasing race horses for the fun of "The Sport of Kings!"</p>
				<p>In 2012, Dennis launched Wise Guys Racing Stable and has began to purchase stock for racing syndication. Current prospects are listed on the Wise Guys link, watch for them at the races now!</p>
				<p>More than ever, now is the time to invest in Thoroughbred Racing. For more information contact Dennis directly at <a href="mailto:dennis@thoroughbredforecast.com">dennis@thoroughbredforecast.com</a>.</p>-->

				<p><em><strong>Thoroughbred Racing Forecast</strong></em> is an annual series of four Nationally Syndicated television specials featuring previews of the BIGGEST RACES in America!</p>
				<p>The season premier is the <em>Kentucky Derby Special</em>, airing the first weekend in May each year, followed shortly by the <em>Preakness and Belmont Specials</em>, and finally rounding out the season with the <em>Breeders Cup Preview</em> in the Fall.</p>
				<p>These programs give the viewer an inside look at these big races, with exclusive interviews from the Track with the Trainers, Jockeys, and Owners.</p>
				<p>The show's host, Dennis Tobler, has been a staple in the race handicapping business in Las Vegas since 1982. Mr. Tobler has been a race horse owner for over 30 years with horses competing at the finest tracks in America. From his first stakes winner, "Golondrina" (Gr. II) in 1988, to "Wizard" (Gr. III) in 1991, to his most recent success, "Indy Weekend" (now standing stud in Oklahoma), Dennis has a unique overview of the entire industry.</p>
				<p>As part of syndicates and privately, Mr. Tobler has had 32 winners (and many more winning races) at 10 different tracks. He has purchased yearlings and bought two-year-olds in training while working with some of the biggest names in the business. He also started, promoted, and broadcast his winning selections on the "Racing Hotlines" known throughout the West on 976#'s, 900#'s, and 800#'s from 1983 through 1995.</p>
				<p>Dennis writes, produces, directs, distributes, and incidentally stars in not only <em><strong>Thoroughbred Racing Forecast</strong></em>, but has spent over 30 years as the host of the widely popular nationally syndicated television show <i><strong>Football Forecast Weekly</strong></i>, found at <a href="https://footballforecast.com" target="_self" title="FootballForecast.com">FootballForecast.com</a> and on over 175 televisions station, nationwide.</p>
<!--				<p>Mr. Tobler retired from public handicapping in 2005, but still continues to bring his tremendous experience and expert knowledge to sports and racing fans through the television shows and as a co-owner of M&S Racing Stable. With M&S no longer in operation, Dennis has launched his own racing enterprise â€” "Wise Guys Racing Stable".</p>-->
